				<p><strong>Everything You Need To Know About Marketing Your Business During The Coronavirus</strong> (And Why It’s More Important Now Than Ever To CONTINUE Your Marketing Efforts!)</br></br>There is so much information floating around regarding COVID-19: how to avoid it, proper hand-washing techniques, practicing social distancing, what to do if you get the virus and more.</br></br>But outside of personal concerns, there are added professional concerns for small business owners trying to minimize financial impact on their businesses during this time.</br></br>If you’re a small business owner, you probably have additional questions like this:</br></br></p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>How is COVID-19 going to affect my business?</strong></li></br></br>
					<li>How should I market my business during this time?</li></br></br>
					<li>SHOULD I even market my business during this time?</li></br></br>
				</ul>
				<p>To answer that last one, absolutely yes, and here’s why:</br></br>At times like these, some businesses have a tendency to pull back or stop their marketing all together (like your competitors!) while the smartest businesses use it as an opportunity to get ahead.</br></br>So which one are you?</br></br>You have two options as a business owner:</br></br><strong>Option #1:</strong> Embrace being a victim, pause all advertising efforts & brace for little to no results.</br></br><strong>Option #2:</strong> Take your business by the horns and maximize this opportunity to get ahead!</br></br>Now, you may be thinking, “Yes of course I would rather see results than not, but how do I do that? How do I market my business through the Coronavirus?”If you sell toilet paper or hand sanitizer, you probably don’t need to read any further. Otherwise, valid question!</br></br>Let’s look at a few ways the rest of us can utilize digital marketing to get ahead and come out on TOP!</p>
